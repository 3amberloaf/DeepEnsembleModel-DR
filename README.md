**Introduction**
Diabetes mellitus is a global disease affecting millions each year, leading to reduced life expectancy, long-term disabilities, and in severe cases mortality. Despite years of research and the endless dedication of doctors, the incidence rate of this disease is projected to rise to over 570.6 million cases by 2025. It was observed that China, India, United States, Indonesia, and Mexico had over 222 million cases in 2017, with China in the lead. Depicted below, the global incidence rate of diabetes has been increasing each year, with Type 2 far surpassing Type 1.

The graph clearly illustrates the worsening trend of diabetes each year, which in turn leads to a myriad of associated health complications. This report explores a revolutionary way to detect diabetic retinopathy, a severe eye disease that can result from long-term untreated diabetes.
